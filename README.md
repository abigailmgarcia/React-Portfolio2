# React-Portfolio2


## Description

I built this project so future empoloyers can have a clean portfolio to look at when Interested in hiring me. This portfolio has some of the projects I have done, and about me section, and links to my github , linkedin, and email adress if they would like to email me. This project also allowed me to expand my knowledge on react and many different language I have learned throught the course by creating a single page mobile responsive application. During this project I also challenged myself to use frameworks I normally have not and learn more about jsx.
